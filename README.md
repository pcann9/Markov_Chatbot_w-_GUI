# Markov_Chatbot_with_GUI
In this repository, I create a one-way chatbot using markov chains with a gui. 


### 1. data prep
In this step, I use R to clean text data to train our chatbot on. It is essential that data is exported as newline delimited as that is what our chatbot model requires.

### 2. chatbot and gui
This step uses python and the module `markovify` to create the chatbot, and the module `tkinter` to create the gui. 

### 3. make executable
This step uses the module `pyinstaller` in order to convert the python script into an executable file that can be run like an ordinary application.
